/**
 * The 94S-135 invariants, read from outside the product: the database and

 * violation arrives with its evidence. Zero rows everywhere is the pass.
 *
 * - context: no context silently reset (the Messages-side check lives in
 *   soak.ts, which sees what each turn's conversation carried);
 * - stale_write: no write accepted from an attempt after it ended or after
 *   a newer attempt of the session claimed;
 * - duplicate_execution: never two live attempts or two running workers for
 *   one session, and no turn run by two attempts;
 * - slot_leak: no slot held for a session that can no longer run, and never
 *   more slots than the limit;
 * - unconfirmed_success: nothing whose outcome is unknown reads as success.
 *
 * Timestamps are transaction starts (defaultNow()), so an ordering check
 * allows `toleranceMs` for a transaction that began just before the fence
 * committed and was serialized behind it.
