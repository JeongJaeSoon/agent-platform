# Checks that a (restored) installation's checkpoint pointers still name the
# bytes they were committed against.
#
# For every row of `checkpoints`: the manifest is downloaded at
# manifest_version and its sha256 compared with manifest_sha256; the manifest
# is then opened and every object it pins (workspace bundle, untracked files,
# transcript parts of root and subagents) is downloaded at the version it
# names and compared the same way; every one of those versions must carry a
# legal hold, and the row must say versions_held; the bundles are finally
# fetched into one empty repository, workspace.baseBundles oldest first and
# then workspace.bundle, and the last must offer workspace.gitCommit as a ref
# tip. Rows that are the session's current pointer (sessions.checkpoint_revision)
# are marked `pointer`. Last, the restored API's own path is asked: its
# `locked` startup bucket check and a restore plan for every pointer.
#
# --image <worker image> asks each plan as a worker of that image would: a
# pointer sealed under another engine, SDK or CLI version fails as
# incompatible. Without it each plan is asked with the checkpoint's own
# runtime, and the image check is printed as SKIP.
#
# Exit 0 when every row passes, 5 when any fails. A database with no
# checkpoints passes with a warning: there was nothing to disagree.
#
