#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Restores a scripts/backup.sh bundle into a NEW compose project.
#
# The target project must not exist: no container, volume or network may carry
# its label, so an existing installation can never be overwritten. Ports are
# bound on loopback from --port-base (postgres, localstack, git host = base,
# base+1, base+2). The git host stays down until something needs it: it holds
# no data.
#
# The objects go into a bucket that must be new as well: versioned, Object
# Lock, SSE-S3 by default, and without a single object version or delete
# marker. --object-store localstack (default) uses the new project's own
# LocalStack and the backup's bucket name, creating the bucket if its init
# did not. --object-store env uses the store the environment names
# (AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
# unless it is AWS S3) and needs --bucket, which may not carry the name of
# the bucket the backup was taken from; the new project then runs no
# LocalStack. The bucket must be this restore's alone: no check can keep
# another writer out of it once the upload starts.
#
# Checkpoint objects get new VersionIds in the new bucket; every checkpoint
# is re-pinned to them and held, so the restored API runs `locked`.
#
# Refusals, by exit code: 2 usage, 3 schema mismatch (the backup's applied
# migrations are not exactly this checkout's, or it holds Gitea data, which
# only a checkout from before Gitea's removal restores), 4 target project or
# bucket not new. A failed re-pin exits 1 and leaves a target to tear down,
# not to retry.
#
# Usage: scripts/restore.sh <backup-dir> --into <project> [--port-base 25432] [--check-only]
#                           [--object-store localstack|env] [--bucket <name>]
