#   objects/        every object in the bucket, key = path; a key a
#                   checkpoint pins holds the bytes of the pinned version
#   manifest.json   schema version (applied migrations), image digests,

#   SHA256SUMS      over all of the above
#
# The source installation is only read. The writers — api, scheduler,
# reconciler, the worker service and every worker container the scheduler
# launched — must be stopped: a checkpoint committed between pg_dump and the
# object copy has a pointer without its objects. The backup refuses to start
# while one runs; --allow-running-writers only warns instead.
#
# It is written to backup-<ts>.partial and renamed to backup-<ts> only once
# complete; a run that fails leaves backup-<ts>.failed.
