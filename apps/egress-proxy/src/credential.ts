 * The proxy's credential routes: the one place a worker's request
 * picks up a provider key or a repository login, which the worker itself

 * authorizer says what it stands for right now and hands back the upstream
 * and the credential; the request goes there with the credential injected
 * and the token stripped.
 *
 * A listener of its own rather than a mode of the forward proxy: this one
 * has to understand each HTTP exchange — one request, its framing, its
 * headers — where the forward proxy deliberately only pipes bytes, and a
 * second request pipelined behind an authorized one must never reach the
 * upstream on its coat-tails. Bun's HTTP server does the framing. Plaintext
 * on the worker's side is fine: only the worker and this proxy sit on a
 * worker's network.
 *
 * Only the operations a session needs are routed — the Messages API, and
 * the read half of git's smart HTTP and of Git LFS — so a leaked token buys at most that,
 * for as long as its attempt still owns its session.
 *
 * The object store route is the one way a worker reaches its
 * objects: the store itself is not on its allowlist. The worker's S3 client
 * sends ordinary S3 requests here with its token as the access key id; the
 * authorizer judges each one against the session's prefix and signs it with
 * the API's key, and only what it signed — its target, its headers — goes
 * upstream. Nothing of the worker's request travels but the body.
