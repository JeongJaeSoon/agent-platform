/**
 * The pre-upgrade check (helm hook `upgrade-check`, or by hand before a
 * `helm rollback`): reads every session holding an uncollected checkpoint
 * and prints one JSON line saying whether the target release's worker
 * images leave any of them with nothing to resume on.
 *
 * Read: `DATABASE_URL`; the target's `WORKER_IMAGE`, `WORKER_IMAGE_RUNTIME`,
 * `WORKER_IMAGE_PREVIOUS`, `WORKER_IMAGE_PREVIOUS_RUNTIME`; the
 * `UPGRADE_DEPLOYED_WORKER_IMAGE` the cluster runs now and its
 * `UPGRADE_DEPLOYED_WORKER_IMAGE_PREVIOUS` (empty when it has none);
 * `UPGRADE_APPROVED_SESSIONS`, a JSON array of session ids; and
 * `UPGRADE_DEPLOYED_STATE`, what the chart read about the deployed release
 * when it has no worker image or runtime to compare:
 *
 * - `absent`: the cluster answered and has no scheduler Deployment. Retrying
 *   a failed first install looks like this, so an unused database passes.
 * - `unpinned`: the scheduler runs one image, with no runtime and no previous
 *   image. Upgrading that same image needs no runtime: nothing is compared.
 *
 * Anything else is no evidence. Returns the exit code: 0 proceed, 2 refused,
 * 1 when the check could not be made (a setting missing or unreadable, the
 * database unreachable), which stops the upgrade as surely as a refusal:
 * there is no override.
