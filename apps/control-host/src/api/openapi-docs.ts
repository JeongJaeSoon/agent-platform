## Authentication

There are two ways to call the API, and they are not interchangeable:

- **Servers and scripts** send an API key as an HTTP bearer token, \`Bearer <key>\` (\`bearerApiKey\`). The key is limited to the scopes it was issued with, and it never needs the CSRF header.
- **The web console** uses the browser session cookie that \`POST /v1/auth/login\` sets (\`cookieSession\`). What it may do follows the user's workspace role, and every request other than GET must send \`X-Requested-With: ${CSRF_HEADER_VALUE}\` and must not be cross-site (\`Sec-Fetch-Site\`, \`Origin\`); otherwise it answers \`403 FORBIDDEN\`.

An API key cannot manage agents, members, teams or API keys, list or stop sessions through the administration operations, read a session outside its share or take a session over: those operations answer it \`403 FORBIDDEN\`, whatever its scopes. A missing, malformed, unknown or revoked credential answers \`401 UNAUTHORIZED\`. \`/healthz\`, \`/readyz\`, \`/v1/openapi.json\`, \`/v1/auth/bootstrap\` and \`/v1/auth/login\` take no credential.

## Scopes

Each operation names the one scope it requires, in its description and in its \`security\` requirement:

- \`sessions:read\`: read sessions, turns, events, pending requests, usage, limits and receipts.
- \`sessions:write\`: create sessions and send messages.
- \`sessions:approve\`: answer pending permission and question requests.
- \`sessions:control\`: interrupt, pause, resume and terminate.
- \`sessions:recover\`: record recovery decisions.

What a credential holds:

- An API key holds exactly the scopes it was issued with (\`scopes\` in \`POST /v1/api-keys\`, or \`--scopes\` in the key CLI). A key issued before scopes existed holds none and must be reissued.
- A cookie session holds the scopes of the user's workspace role: \`owner\` holds all five, \`admin\` and \`member\` all but \`sessions:recover\`.
- A credential without the required scope answers \`403 FORBIDDEN\` before the body or the resource is read.

## Idempotency

Each command (any method but GET) says in its description whether \`Idempotency-Key\` is required or ignored. Where it is required, send 1–255 characters; a missing or invalid key answers \`400 BAD_REQUEST\`. The key is scoped to the caller, the operation and the target resource. Retrying with the same key and the same body returns the original status and body without running the command again; the same key with a different body answers \`409 IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT\`. After a timeout or a lost response, retry with the same key rather than a new one. Where it is ignored, nothing is replayed: a retry runs the command again, so reread the resource before retrying.

## Errors

Every error answers \`application/json\` with \`{"error": {"code", "message", "retryable", "request_id", "details"}}\` (\`ApiErrorResponse\`). Branch on \`code\`, not on \`message\`. \`retryable: true\` means the same request may succeed later unchanged (\`REQUEST_TIMEOUT\`, \`RATE_LIMITED\`, \`BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE\`, \`NOT_READY\`). Each response below lists its codes and when each one happens.

## Response headers

- \`X-Request-Id\`: on every response, a fresh id for this request; an error's \`request_id\` is the same value. Quote it when reporting a problem.
- \`Retry-After\`: seconds to wait, on \`429 RATE_LIMITED\` and on \`503 BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE\`.`;
