 * Stores a flow the way @use-funnel/react-router does: the step is in the URL
 * as `?<id>.step=`, and history.state holds the states that led to it. Each
 * history entry keeps its own copy, so back, forward and a reload come back
 * to the step and its input; a copied URL carries no input and starts over.
 * Unlike that adapter, unmounting leaves the entry alone: StrictMode's
 * second mount would otherwise wipe the state it just restored.
 *
 * With `restart`, mounting starts over: a flow in a dialog mounts when the
 * dialog opens, and the entry still holds where it was when last closed.
