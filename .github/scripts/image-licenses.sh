# The notices are computed from bun.lock; this is where that model meets a
# built image. Every npm package under /app must be listed for this app, the
# Bun builds and license texts the notices name must be the ones inside, and
# /app/DEBIAN_SOURCES.md must match the installed packages (the script runs
# on the image's own Bun, with the checkout mounted read-only). Every Debian
# package must carry the copyright file the notices point to. Shared by images.yml's build and publish jobs, like image-smoke.sh.
