# Whether snapshot.debian.org holds every source a publish ships:
# `image-sources.sh <list dir> <result dir> <main|release> [<prior dir> <held out dir>]`.
#
# <list dir> holds <app>-<arch>.md, each image's /app/DEBIAN_SOURCES.md. The six
# lists share nearly all their sources, so they are asked about once, here,
# rather than per image: the service is a volunteer one that answers about half
# of what it is asked. It imports the archive every few hours, so a build right
# after a Debian security release can list a version it does not hold yet.
#
# A source the service denies stops the publish. One it did not answer for
# stops a release; a main build goes out with it, listed for the images that
# ship it in <result dir>/<app>.json: the file exists after every check, so `[]`
# means checked and its absence never reads as "none". The budget keeps an
# outage inside the job's timeout.
