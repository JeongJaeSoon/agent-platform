#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Retags a run's staged digests: `image-promote.sh <staged dir> <published dir>`.
#
# <staged dir> holds one JSON per image from the index job, its digest a
# multi-arch index. Which tags are
# written depends on what the run was started by, so a main run can never
# write a version or sha tag. A tag that already names a different digest fails
# the promotion before any tag is written, so one tag never mixes images from
# two build attempts. A half-promoted set (failure between repositories) is
# completed with "Re-run failed jobs" on the same run while its staged-digests
# artifact still exists: the publish and index jobs are not rerun, and the tags
# written before the failure name exactly those digests. A full rerun builds again (the
# apt layer is not pinned) and is refused by design. The lookup fails closed:
# only a confirmed "not found" counts as absent. After tagging, every reference
# is read back and must name its candidate before <published dir> is written.
