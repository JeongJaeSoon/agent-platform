# Turns the staged digests of a main push into the staged digests of its
# release: `release-stage.sh <main staged dir> <release unverified dir> <out dir>`
# with RELEASE_REF=refs/tags/vX.
#
# The release carries the digests main already built, smoked, scanned and
# staged, so what was scanned is what ships. Only what a release must say
# differently changes: `ref` becomes the tag ref (release-manifest.ts requires
# an image to be published from the ref it releases), the original ref is kept
# as `buildRef`, and `unverifiedSources` is the strict list of this release,
# not the lenient one main allows.
