# Gives a tag a GitHub Release that carries its manifest and, optionally, more
# files: `release-publish.sh <tag> <release-manifest.json> [<file>...]`, with
# GH_REPO and GH_TOKEN set (contents: write).
#
# The Release is a draft until every file has been read back, so nobody sees a
# release without its manifest or with half its bundle. A rerun of the same tag
# converges: a file already there with the same content passes, one with other
# content fails and nothing is overwritten, and a half-done earlier run (draft,
# missing or unfinished asset) is completed. A *.json file is compared as JSON,
# any other byte for byte. A lookup that fails is never taken for "absent".
