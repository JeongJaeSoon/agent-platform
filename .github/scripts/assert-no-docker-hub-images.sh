# Fails when a Docker daemon holds an image from Docker Hub: CI pulls those
# from its ghcr.io mirror (ci-image-mirror.yml, 94S-308). It looks at what
# was actually pulled, so it catches a Docker Hub pull however it was made —
# a service, a `docker run` in a step, or a suite calling the Engine API with
# a name no static check recognizes.
#
# The rule is "not Docker Hub", not "only the mirror": the runner image ships
# images of its own (ghcr.io/github/..., ghcr.io/dependabot/...) that no step
# pulled.
#
# usage: assert-no-docker-hub-images.sh <docker command...>
#   e.g. assert-no-docker-hub-images.sh docker
#        assert-no-docker-hub-images.sh env DOCKER_HOST=unix:///tmp/apq/docker.sock docker

# Judged by where each image was pulled from, i.e. its RepoDigests. An image
# built on the daemon has none and is skipped. What it was built FROM is not
# reliably listed (BuildKit need not register the base as an image), so a
# build step must name its base by a mirror reference itself.
#
# Assignments, so a daemon that cannot answer fails here rather than
# reading as an empty, clean list.
