/**
 * The git-backed `WorkspaceBundleVerifier`: proves the bundle's pack really
 * holds the commit it claims, which is the one thing bytes alone cannot show.
 *
 * `git bundle verify` only reads the header, so a pack whose header was
 * rewritten passes it. A fetch into an empty bare repository does not: git
 * indexes every object, fsck-checks it, and then walks from the ref tip to
 * make sure every reachable object arrived. `rev-list --objects` afterwards
 * repeats that walk for the commit the manifest pinned, so the verdict covers
 * the pinned commit rather than whichever ref the bundle happened to name.
 *
 * Two kinds of failure, kept apart because the service turns a verdict into
 * a permanent rejection and a throw into a retryable outage. Git refusing the
 * pack — a missing or corrupt object, a tip the pack did not deliver — is a
 * verdict about the bundle and comes back `unusable`. Everything else — no
 * temp space, no git binary, a spawn failure, a repository that would not
 * initialise, a git killed by a signal or by the timeout, a git or helper
 * that ran out of the memory, file size or CPU it is allowed, or a failure
 * this code does not recognise — is thrown, so a healthy checkpoint is never
 * retired over a full disk or a busy host. Recognition is by git's own
 * wording under `LC_ALL=C`; the list is git's refusals, not the OS errors, so
 * that an unknown message errs toward a retry rather than a rejection.
 *
 * Running out of a limit is a fault rather than a verdict for the same
 * reason the timeout is: "Out of memory" reads the same whether the pack
 * asked for too much or the host had too little, and a limit sized wrong
 * must not retire a healthy checkpoint for good. A hostile bundle is retried
 * instead, and every retry costs no more than the limits allow.
 *
 * Nothing about this run outlives it: the repository is created under a fresh
 * temp directory and removed whichever way the run ends.
