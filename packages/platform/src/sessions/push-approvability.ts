 * (push-requests.ts decide, push-request-service.ts decide), judged the same
 * way and never stricter: the canonical rule for every surface that shows
 * a push as awaiting approval.
 *
 * An intent request is pinned to the revision its turn ended on, so the
 * pointer moving is no reason: it stays approvable while that revision still
 * verifies and carries the request's commit (`pinned_source_invalid` else).
 *
 * Without a `source` (the slack role holds no checkpoint store) a moved
 * revision counts as approvable: the commit is unknown there, and showing
 * a push as approvable that the server would refuse costs less than hiding
 * one it would take.
