 * Who may do what to a member of the workspace (design 4.1): the one place
 * the rule lives. The stores call it on the rows they locked, and the member
 * list calls it on the rows it read, so what a row offers is what a write
 * accepts.
 *
 * No count of the workspace's owners goes in. With yourself refused and an
 * owner's row only an owner's to change, the actor of any change to an owner
 * is another live owner, so the target is never the last one. Only two owners
 * demoting or disabling each other at once get there, and the write sees that
 * under its row locks (`last_owner`).
