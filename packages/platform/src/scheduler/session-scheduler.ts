/**
 * One scheduling pass. Each step is its own set of transactions so a crash
 * between them leaves only intents the next pass can pick up again:
 *
 * 1. Every live execution row is inspected; a missing resource is re-ensured
 *    from the stored intent, an exited one is recorded and reclaimed, and
 *    one with a kill intent is torn down.
 * 2. Provider resources without a matching row are logged and terminated,
 *    then isolation resources whose execution is gone are removed and the
 *    ones that lost their attachments repaired — before admission, so a
 *    launch never waits on an address pool held by a leak.
 * 3. Remaining slots are filled: reserve (commit) then ensure, never inside
 *    the transaction.
 * Terminate receipts whose kill was not confirmed within the deadline are
 * reported unknown once the rows have been reconciled.
 * 4. Workspaces of sessions nothing will come back to are reclaimed. Last,
 *    so a slow daemon listing never delays a launch.
