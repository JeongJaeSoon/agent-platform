 * Decides whether a stored git bundle can put a workspace back on a commit.
 *
 * It is a port because the only answer worth trusting comes from git itself.
 * `git index-pack --strict` reconstructs every packed object through its delta
 * chain, which is what proves the commit is in there; nothing short of that
 * distinguishes a real pack from bytes shaped like one. The control plane does
 * not run git, so the implementation is injected.
 *
 * The service supplies a local file rather than the key so that the size
 * policy stays in one place: whatever a deployment plugs in, it never decides
 * on its own how much of the object store to pull in. A file rather than the
 * bytes because a bundle is sized by the workspace, not by what fits in
 * memory, and a git-backed verifier needs one on disk anyway. The file holds
 * exactly the bytes the manifest's digest names — the service checks that
 * before asking — and it exists only for the duration of the call: read it,
 * never move, modify or keep it.
