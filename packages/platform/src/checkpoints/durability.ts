/**
 * What each refusal means for the session, once the runtime reports it.
 *
 * - `ordinary`: a turn in flight, or a run that has not started one. The next
 *   safe boundary checkpoints as usual; nothing is recorded.
 * - `blocking`: a dropped mirror batch. The stored transcript is short entries
 *   nobody can enumerate and every later turn builds on a session that cannot
 *   be restored, so it is recorded and holds work back until a checkpoint from
 *   *another* attempt commits (this run's transcript never recovers).
 * - `advisory`: the run was not quiescent — a tool still running, a background
 *   task (a dev server may run for hours, §1.1), or another checkpoint holding
 *   the lease. The previous generation stays the one to resume from and the
 *   reason is recorded so it is visible, but work goes on: holding turns back
 *   for a server the agent was asked to keep running would stall the session.
 *   Any later commit clears it, from this attempt or another.
 *   `publish_failed` is the same for a run that was ready but whose checkpoint
 *   could not be written — a workspace the capture refused, a manifest over
 *   the limits, a store that failed. The ones that persist (a workspace too
 *   large to capture) are not fixed by holding turns back, and a replaced
 * worker still refuses to go on past turns no checkpoint covers.
 * - `exhausted`: the transcript is past `TRANSCRIPT_LIMITS`, and it only ever
 *   grows, so no later checkpoint of this engine session can carry it. New
 *   turns are refused, as for `blocking`, but the session is not broken: the
 *   turn that crossed the limit ran and is recorded completed without a
 *   checkpoint, and the last committed checkpoint is still the one to resume
 *   from. It is cleared the way a blocking reason is, or by start_fresh.
