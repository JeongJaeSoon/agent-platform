// A PGlite's WebAssembly memory takes about 4 GiB of the room Bun on Linux
// has for all ArrayBuffers together (about 60 GiB, a fixed reservation):
// JSC reserves the whole 32-bit address space for its first memories so it
// can skip bounds checks. `close()` keeps that memory, and a test file keeps
// its last instance in module-level variables for the rest of the process.
// Eight such files left half the room taken for the whole run, and a later
// allocation that did not fit failed with "RangeError: Out of memory", as did
// every pipe read after it (94S-436). Dropping the Emscripten module on close
// lets the memory go even while the closed instance stays referenced.
