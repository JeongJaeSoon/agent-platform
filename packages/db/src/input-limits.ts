 * always lock in the same order.
 *
 * This only checks. The charge is the `turns` insert trigger from migration
 * 0107, so a writer that knows nothing of the limit (an API build from
 * before it, still running during a rollout) is counted too. The row lock
 * taken here is held until the caller's turn insert commits, so two
 * acceptances racing for the last bytes serialize and the second one reads
 * the first one's charge.
 *
 * `sessionId` is null for a session this transaction is creating: it has no
 * queued turns yet, and the limit is at least one.
