 * statement: each session's newest events by the (session_id, id) index, so
 * the cost follows the page size and the window, not a session's history.
 * Calls, results and their states follow the agent map's run tree
 * (packages/react run-tree.ts). The window is a suffix of the stream, so a
 * call inside it has its result, question and turn end inside it too.
 *
 * Calls pair with results by grouping one stream, never by joining: the
 * planner cannot estimate rows filtered on jsonb fields and chose nested
 * loops of window × window per page.
