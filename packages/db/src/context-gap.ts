 * The facts a restore rests on: the last turn that ran, and the turn the

 * no turn it came after, so it covers none; the inner join leaves it out.
 *
 * `revision` names another checkpoint to judge coverage on, still only when
 * the pointer is a restore point. A pause passes the base a fallback restore
 * left the session on (94S-204), since that is what a resume would restore.
 * The gap check keeps the pointer: turns a fallback dropped were reported
 * by the fallback itself, so they are not a loss nobody was told about.
